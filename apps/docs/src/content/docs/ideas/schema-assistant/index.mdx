## Visual Concepts

### Conversational Interface

```typescript
Developer: "I need to add comments to my blog posts"

AI Assistant: "I'll help you add a comment system! Based on your existing blog schema, I recommend:

1. Create a 'comments' table with:
   - postId (reference to blog posts)
   - authorId (user reference) 
   - content (string)
   - createdAt (timestamp)
   - parentId (for nested comments)

2. Add these relationships:
   - posts.comments (one-to-many)
   - users.comments (one-to-many)

Would you like me to generate the schema code and migration plan?"
```

### Schema Visualization

Interactive diagrams showing:
- **Entity Relationships**: Visual connections between tables
- **Query Paths**: Optimized access patterns with performance metrics
- **Performance Hotspots**: Areas needing attention with specific recommendations
- **Migration Impact**: Visual representation of what changes when you modify schemas
