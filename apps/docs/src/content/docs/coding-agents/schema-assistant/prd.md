# AI-Powered Schema Assistant - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The AI-Powered Schema Assistant is a conversational AI agent integrated into the Convex development environment that helps developers design, migrate, and optimize database schemas through natural language interactions. This feature addresses the complexity barrier that slows schema evolution and makes Convex more accessible to developers of all experience levels.

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

**As a full-stack developer**, I want to describe my data needs in plain English so that I can quickly create optimized schemas without deep Convex expertise.

**As a team lead**, I want automated migration planning so that I can confidently make schema changes without risking data loss or downtime.

**As a new Convex user**, I want interactive guidance so that I can learn best practices while building my first application.

**As a senior developer**, I want performance optimization suggestions so that I can proactively improve query efficiency.

### Secondary User Stories

**As a DevOps engineer**, I want rollback-ready migrations so that I can safely deploy schema changes in production.

**As a product manager**, I want schema impact analysis so that I can understand the implications of feature requests.

### Data Models

#### Conversation Context
```typescript
interface ConversationContext {
  projectId: string;
  currentSchema: SchemaDefinition;
  conversationHistory: Message[];
  userPreferences: UserPreferences;
  activeSession: SessionMetadata;
}
```

#### Schema Analysis
```typescript
interface SchemaAnalysis {
  tables: TableAnalysis[];
  relationships: RelationshipMap;
  queryPatterns: QueryPattern[];
  performanceMetrics: PerformanceData;
  optimizationSuggestions: Suggestion[];
}
```

#### Migration Plan
```typescript
interface MigrationPlan {
  steps: MigrationStep[];
  rollbackPlan: RollbackStep[];
  riskAssessment: RiskAnalysis;
  estimatedDuration: Duration;
  prerequisites: Prerequisite[];
}
```

## API Specifications

### Chat API
```typescript
POST /api/schema/chat
{
  message: string;
  context: ConversationContext;
  projectId: string;
}

Response: {
  reply: string;
  codeGenerated?: string;
  suggestions: Suggestion[];
  followUpQuestions: string[];
}
```

### Migration API
```typescript
POST /api/schema/migrate
{
  targetSchema: SchemaDefinition;
  options: MigrationOptions;
}

Response: {
  plan: MigrationPlan;
  estimatedRisk: RiskLevel;
  rollbackStrategy: RollbackPlan;
}
```

### Analysis API
```typescript
GET /api/schema/analyze/{projectId}

Response: {
  analysis: SchemaAnalysis;
  optimizations: Optimization[];
  healthScore: number;
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- **Local Processing**: Schema analysis happens locally when possible
- **Encrypted Communication**: All API calls use TLS 1.3
- **Data Retention**: Conversation history encrypted and auto-deleted
- **Access Control**: Integration with Convex project permissions

### Code Safety
- **Validation**: All generated code validated before execution
- **Sandboxing**: Migration testing in isolated environments
- **Audit Logging**: Complete history of schema changes and AI suggestions
- **Rollback Protection**: Automatic backups before migrations

### AI Safety
- **Output Filtering**: Prevent generation of harmful or incorrect code
- **Confidence Scoring**: AI indicates certainty levels for suggestions
- **Human Review**: Critical changes require explicit developer confirmation
- **Fallback Modes**: Graceful degradation when AI services unavailable

## Performance Requirements

### Response Times
