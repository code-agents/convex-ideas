## Why Convex Ideas?

This repository serves as a **bridge between community vision and product development**. By structuring each idea with clear value propositions, detailed requirements, and release narratives, we create a resource that:

- **Inspires Innovation**: Showcase what's possible with Convex
- **Guides Development**: Provide clear roadmaps for implementation
- **Aligns Vision**: Ensure community ideas align with Convex's strategic direction
- **Accelerates Delivery**: Give the Convex team ready-to-implement specifications
